- 😄 Pronouns: Trying to figure it out.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a 65 year-old, old school geek. The first computer I used was a NCR Century 200. The Mainframe computer I used while I attended a class referred to as "Data Processing" at the local Tech-School. Thanks to this influence I doubled majored in college with both a math and computer science degrees.
